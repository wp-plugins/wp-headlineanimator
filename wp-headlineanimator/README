1 - Introduction:
=================
 WP-Headlineanimator is a Plugin for Wordpress. It generates an animated 
 GIF File to be displayed in signatures or wherever you like to advertise
 for your Blog.

2 - Requirements:
=================
 1 - Wordpress > 2.0
 2 - some time
 3 - Access to your webserver
 4 - A background picture for your signature

3 - Features:
=============
 - As a forum signature can be called _very_often_, it is pointless generating
   the picture from scratch via PHP
 - The gif image is updated everytime you WRITE, DELETE or MODIFY a post.
 - The Plugin is Polyglot-Compatible (this is a plugin for multilingual blogs)

4 - Installation:
=================
 1 - Upload the contents of the wp-headlineanimator directory into your
     wordpress plugin directory.
 2 - make sure that wp-headlineanimator/tmp is writeable for wordpress
     as some temp-data is stored there
 3 - Activate the Plugin
 4 - Configure the Plugin via the admin interface
 5 - Enjoy

5 - Todo:
=========
  - getting rid of the tmp-images
  - code cleanup
  - internal upload for the background image
  - a generic template for everyone as default

6 - Bugs:
